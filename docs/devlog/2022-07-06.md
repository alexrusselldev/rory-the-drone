## 2022-07-06

I'm starting this project as an entry point to learning [OpenSCAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSCAD) and to get experience with the process of designing, building, flying and then iteratively improving on a basic multirotor. This project will be fully open source, in the hopes that it might be used by others. I'm designing the project with the goal that it is simple, lightweight and can be easily produced with minimal investment. Currently the design relies on the use of a CNC router and a 3D printer although, with enough care, the carbon parts may be able to be cut by hand.

I have started this project with a very basic initial build design. I have set a milestone on 2022-07-27, which is when I will be paid and able to begin ordering materials in. I intend to follow semantic versioning for the code, with every major version bump being the point at which I build vehicles. The v1 build is intended to be flyable, with no extra functionality. I will be building it as simply as possible around a flight controller. After successful (or not) flights of v1, the vehicle will go through a process of remediation and improvement. As soon as I am comfortable with the performance of the vehicle, I will begin working on v2.

Due to the very modular design of the drone, v2 seems like a good point to begin working on a system for attaching and controlling peripherals. This stage of the project will likely require the development of software to run on the drone, as I intend to use a small computer, such as a raspberry Pi, to control the peripherals.

For now, this seems like a good place to finish my devlog. I will be trying to commit to making entries at least once a week.
